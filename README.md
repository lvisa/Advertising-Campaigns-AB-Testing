# Advertising-Campaigns-AB-Testing
This research examines the effectiveness of targeted advertisements compared to public service announcements (PSAs) by analyzing data from 588,101 participants exposed to a varying number of ads. Using techniques such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and hypothesis testing, the study aims to understand how ad exposure influences conversion rates, and to ensure that comparisons between the ad and PSA groups are fair by accounting for potential biases.
